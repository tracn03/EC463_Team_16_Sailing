## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous sailing research vessel for long-duration environmental monitoring missions. We're building a wind-powered platform with GPS waypoint navigation, partnering with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to deploy RF transmitters for NOAA weather radar calibration. 

Deliverables include: 
- An intermediate, motor driven vessel, prototype

- Autonomous and manual control

- Vessel software, version-controlled in GitHub

- Web UI hosted on a public server

- Test results for weather radar calibration
